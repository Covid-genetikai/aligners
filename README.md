# Tested algorithms:

1. Clustalw2
2. Muscle

# Clustalw2

### pros:

1. Have parallel implementations
2. Can produce trees

### cons:

1. aligns poorly in case sequence have holes

# Muscle

### pros:

1. Produce really good alignments even with holes in sequence

### cons:

1. Hard to make it work parallel
